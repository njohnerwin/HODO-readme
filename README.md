# Good README Generator

A simple Node program designed to generate useful README files. Originally developed as a project for the UCONN Coding Bootcamp. Please note that the original assignment had a requirement to also include an open-source license in the generated README file - I have deliberately omitted this requirement, as properly implementing an open-source license requires more than a simple text append to a README. The README files generated should be easy to edit, so you shouldn't have any trouble adding a license yourself through the proper methods.

## Installation

'npm install' for dependencies (Inquirer) and then 'node index.js' (requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org))

## Usage

Run with 'node index.js' and then answer the provided questions. You will be prompted for a filename (extension not required.) All files produced are markdown (.md) files. If no filename is given, the default will be 'README.md'
